# Bootcamp Generation: Arrays and Loops Exercises

## Este repositorio contiene una serie de ejercicios sobre arreglos (arrays) y ciclos (loops) que forman parte del bootcamp de Generation. A continuación, se presentan los ejercicios y sus descripciones:

> **Exercise #1** (sugerencia: join())

Copy the code below into your workspace:

```let arr = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."];```

```function printOutString() {```

  ```// your code here```
  
```}```

```printOutString();```

Complete the function to print out the string: This is a sentence.

##

> **Exercise #2** (sugerencia map())

Write a function that:

Takes in an array of numbers.

Doubles the value of each number in the array.

Prints out the new updated array.

Example: 

Given an array ```[1, 2, 4, 5]```. The output should be ```[2, 4, 8, 10]```

##

> **Exercise #3** (sugerencia reduce())

Write a program to compute the sum and product (multiplication) of an array of numbers.

Print out the sum and the product.

Example: Given an array ```[1, 2, 3, 4]``` The sum is ```10```. The product is ```24```.

##

> **Exercise #4** (sugerencia filter() e includes())

```let student1Courses = ['Math', 'English', 'Programming'];```

```let student2Courses = ['Geography', 'Spanish', 'Programming'];```

Create a program that loops over the ```2 arrays```; if there are any common courses print them out to the console.

##

> **Exercise #5**

For each of the exercises below, assume you are starting with the following people array.

```let people = ["Maria", "Dani", "Luis", "Juan", "Camila"];```

Write a command that prints out all of the people in the list.

Write the command to remove ```"Dani"``` from the array.

Write the command to remove ```"Juan"``` from the array.

Write the command to move ```"Luis"``` to the front of the array.

Write the command to add ```your name``` to the end of the array.

Using a loop, iterate through this array and after ```console.log "Maria"```, exit from the loop.

Write the command that gives the indexOf where ```"Maria"``` is located.

At the end of the exercise, there should be ```4``` people in the array.

##

> **OPTIONAL: Exercise # 6**

Write a function that performs the bubble algorithm.

```Input [3, 6, 12, 5, 100, 1]```

```Output [1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 100]```
